# Peribot::GroupMe

Peribot::GroupMe is designed and intended to be a toolbox of components that
you can use to connect Peribot instances to GroupMe. It is designed to allow
instances to operate as either GroupMe bots or full users, and it simplifies
tasks like sending images as part of messages.

Eventually, I plan to write additional documentation on how Peribot::GroupMe
can be effectively used, likely as part of more extensive documentation on
creating and running Peribot instances. However, the code is relatively simple
and should give a good understanding of how this gem can be used.
