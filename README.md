# Peribot::GroupMe

Peribot::GroupMe allows [Peribot]-powered bots to easily send and receive
GroupMe messages. It is incredibly simple to configure in most cases, yet
allows for a good amount of flexibility in how your bot operates.

Thanks to push notification support, there's no need to run a web server and
manage callback URLs as GroupMe typically requires. Running a bot with
Peribot::GroupMe is now as simple as running a script!

## How can I use it?

For a basic introduction to Peribot and Peribot::GroupMe, take a look at the
[Zero to Peribot] tutorial on the Peribot wiki. This is essentially a "Hello,
world!" project for the framework that results in a simple GroupMe bot.
